# Sourcing the components

For sourcing the components, you have two options:

## Source them yourself

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

The Elite-C Adapters are open-source. At this moment, the flexible PCBs are not. Instead, you can use Amoebas.


**Note: please use Elite-C adapter V1.3**

Parts list:

| Part name  | Amount |  Link |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Amoebas  | 42  | |
| Elite-C | 2  | |
| Elite-C adapter PCB V1.4 | 2  | https://github.com/Bastardkb/Elite-C-holder |
| SOD123 Diodes | 42  | |
| Wires |   | 28 AWG recommended |
| M4 8mm Torx Screw | 14  | Conrad |
| M4 screw insert, M4 X D6.0 X L5.0  | 14  | https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000232925592.html?spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.6aef4f282LZO4v |
| Audio jack, SMD | 2  |  |


If you want RGB, you will also need:

| Part name  | Amount |  Link |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| FlexStrip cables | 6  | Farnell |
| 28AWG Cables | 6  | Aliexpress |
| SK6812 Mini-E LEDs | 42  | Aliexpress |

If you want to print the case yourself, you can also get just the electronics Kit.


# Sourcing the case

The STL, STEP and Fusion files are included in this Github.
Feel free to modify them at length. The files are on a non-commercial license, so this is for personal projects only - please do not use those to sell them.

The cases are printed at 0.15 mm layer height using Prusament Galaxy Black on a Prusa MK3s.

I check and post-process each case individually to make sure it matches very high quality standards.
